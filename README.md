# QR-CODE-GENERATOR

This is a very simple QR Code Generator which only needs some of the few specific commands to execute and you're ready to go, pal!

 First of all, afer opening the files or extracting (whichever may seem fruitful to you) , be sure to type the command : 
 npm init -y 
 (this command shall install all the node packages you would need)

 Then after you do so, type in :
 node index.js
 (this would give you a prompt to type a URL you want to bring the QR CODE of)

 After typing the URL and hitting enter you'd get a message that its been done and you can check that by seeing a file named "qr-img" which would contain the QR code of the webpage/URL you entered in the prompt.
 (scan the QR code with your smartphone/tablet and get the resultant QR!)

 Thank you, that's all.
